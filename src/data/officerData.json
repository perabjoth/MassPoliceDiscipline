    "Allegation_Details": "At 1627 hours on January 8, 2023 Officer Barnes received a call at 411 Washington Street for a larceny report.  The 911 Call came in at 1423 hours and was held for approximately 90  minutes.  The call was coded as a priority 7 call.  \n\nOfficer Barnes responded to the 90 minute old, priority 7 call with his emergency lights activated and proceeded to drive through two red lights without stopping or slowing down.  At roll call, 20 minutes prior to this call Barnes received training in rule 302.  \n\nBarnes disregarded the training he received in the police academy and the roll call training he received immediately before going to this call.  Barnes put the public and himself in harm's way with his unsafe driving in addition to creating liability for the department.  \n\nPO Barnes violated rule 302 sec. 4.1 (Emergency Driving)\n\nRefer to Sergeant Crossen and Lieutenant Walsh's Form 26's as well as the preserved FLIR Video in Sergeant Crossen's possession.  \n\nIt should be noted that On March 23, 2023 Officer Barnes was found at fault for rear ending a motor vehicle (I232022447).\n\nOn February 2, 2023 Officer Barnes violated rules 309 sec. 4 (Evidence and Found Property) and rule 102 sec. 4 (Neglect of Duty) when he discarded evidence/personal property in the dumpster.  Additionally, he failed to document it in his incident report.  Again, Officer Barnes opened himself and the department up to liability.  \n\nRefer to Lieutenant Walsh's Form 26.  \n\nOn February 8, 2023 Officer Barnes violated rule 309 sec. 4 (Evidence and Found Property) when he again discarded evidence in the dumpster. \n\nRefer to Lieutenant Walsh's Form 26.\n  \nOn February 12, 2023 Officer Barnes violated rule 102 sec 4 (Neglect of Duty/Judgement) when he delayed and was hesitant putting out a broadcast to fellow officers pertaining to a BOLO for a person with a gun.  Officer Barnes stated that he did not want to get involved in making the broadcast for the suspects location which created an officer safety issue.  \n\nSergeant Crossen is in possession of FLIR camera footage of the incident. \n\nOn February 26, 2023 Officer Barnes violated rule 102 sec. 4 (Neglect of Duty) when he responded to a motor vehicle accident where a vehicle crashed into several cars rendering it disabled and blocking the opposite lane of traffic on a congested street in the North End and failed to remain on scene to assist with traffic and maintain scene safety until the vehicle was towed.  Officer Barnes had to be called back to the scene to secure the scene by Patrol Supervisor Sergeant Crossen. \n\nRefer to Sergeant Crossen's Form 26. \n\nOn March 4, 2023 Officer Barnes Violated rule 102 sec 4 (Neglect of Duty) (2 counts) when he responded to a call for a motor vehicle accident with a drunk driver.  Officer Barnes misceled the call with a 15P and left the scene.  A few hours later another call came in reporting the vehicle was still disabled, blocking the road, that the vehicle was missing a tire, had struck several cars and that the operator was unresponsive in the car and there was a large quantity of marijuana inside the vehicle.  Officer Barnes responded back to the scene and again miceled the call never addressing the mva with multiple vehicles, the potentially intoxicated driver or the large amount of marijuana in the vehicle as reported by the Boston Fire Department.  \n\nRefer to Sergeant McClay's Form 26\n\nOn May 7th Officer Barnes violated rules 102 sec. 9 (Respectful Treatment) and 102 sec. 8 (Directives and Orders) when he disproportionately responded to a disagreement (over officer Barnes actions/inaction on scene with a hostile crowd while officers were attempting to gain control of them-body camera preserved) with Officer Entwistle in the guardroom and failed to follow an order/directive from Captain McCormick to stand down.    \n\nRefer to Captain McCormick's Form 26 along with the Form 26's of the Officers present during the incident. \n\nThe number, type and frequency of rule violations accumulated is such a short period of time by a probationary officer raises serious concerns for this captain.    \n\nI am adding an additional attachment that documents Officer Barne's behavior but were not entered as rule violations.",

He further reported that he made observations of Detective Deery being unsteady on his feet, having glossy eyes and made note of an odor of alcohol emanating from Detective Deery. Captain Shawm Martin observed Detective Deery to have glossy eyes, walking both slowly and deliberately, and speaking slowly. Captain Martin immediately recognized that Detective Deery was not acting in his normal capacity and concurred with Lieutenant Demesmin�s assessment that Detective Deery was intoxicated while on duty. Lieutenant Thomas Leahy was also present with Captain Martin and Lieutenant Detective Demesmin as they made their observations. \n\nDetective Deery�s service weapon was taken into custody, and he was relieved of duty pending further investigative steps. The determination was made that Detective Deery was unfit to operate a motor vehicle safely and was transported home by Detective David Juba. A search of Detective Deery�s workspace yielded four empty bottles of wine which were photographed and collected. Detective Deery refused several of the A-1 Commanders request to submit to alcohol testing. \n\nAdministrative reports to be completed and forwarded to the Bureau of Investigative Services.",
